2.1) The miss rate decreases.
     This is because when block size increases, the miss rate decreases, due to special locality.

2.2) The miss rate decreases.
     More data can be stored in cache when the size of cache doulbes, thus the miss rate
decreases.

2.3) Demand, Compulsory and capacity misses decreased.
     Same reason as above.

2.4) The capacity miss decreased as cache size increases. When cache gets large, the performance would decrease.

2.5) Demand miss rate and conflict misses increases.
     Since the cache size is small, less data stored in cache, miss rate increases.

2.6) Miss rate decreases. Larger cache size, less capacity and conflict miss.

2.7) The performance of the cache with a L2 cache is better. Since miss in L1 would be stored in L2, this reduce memory access and improve performance.

3) With only L1 cache, it performs the best when using 32k cache with 128byte block and 2 way association.
   First, the performance of 32k cache and 64k cache is similar. Second, the performance of 2-way and 4-way association is small.
