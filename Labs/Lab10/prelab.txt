Exercise 1
1) malloc allocates memory from low address to high address, and it starts from wherever 
the previous allocated memory ends.

2) malloc allocates extra space for each call. It used that extra space to store some
bookkeeping information.

3) It only changes after 7 times itâ€™s called, because heap allocates memory dynamically.
sbrk requests more memory from the system and here it only asks for more space after malloc
called 7 times.

4) 0x1dbb020 ~ 0x1dd4070
Therefore, around 102480 bytes.
