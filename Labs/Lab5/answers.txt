1.(a) In my solution, the memory map starts from(text section) 0x00400000.
But in the complier's memory map, it starts from(text section) 0x00400390.
This is probably because c is a higher level language than MIPS, so the system searches for starting position dynamically when running c. 
(b) There is also is slight difference between where the text section ends. 
(c) In complier's memory, it distinguishes the data section from read only data section, which starts rigth after text section ends, and other data section(initialized/uninitialized), which starts from 200000 bytes after the end of the read only data.
(d) I cant see what's going on in the stack section from the complier's memory.
(e) There is no heap section, which is same as expected.

2. "T" represents that is in the text(code) section. 
"main" is marked with "T" because here main is just the name of the function.It doesnt't represent anything executable.

3. "B" means the symbal is in the uninitialized data section.
These global data arent initialized when they are created.
